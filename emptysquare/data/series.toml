<p>In this series of articles I argue that "black box" testing is insufficient to validate a networked application. Such a program has two ends that take inputs and provide outputs: one is its public API, but the other is its communication over the network. Only by treating it as a black pipe can we test both surfaces.</p>

<p>I wrote Python for years while holding mistaken notions about the Global Interpreter Lock, and I've met others in the same boat. The GIL's effect is simply this: only one thread can execute Python code at a time, while N other threads sleep or await network I/O. Let's read CPython interpreter source and try some examples to grok the GIL, and learn to write fast and thread-safe Python.</p>

<p>I've been talking at conferences for a few years, and reflecting on what I do that is effective or not. This series describes a methodical approach for proposing a talk, writing it, rehearsing and refining your performance, and delivering the talk in front of a large audience.</p>
