September 27 and October 1, 2023. Ivan, an itinerant climber, and his dog Rudy. I can't decide which is my favorite photo of him making breakfast from his truck, or which is my favorite of him lead-rope soloing [Teeny Face](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106733193/teeny-face) (5.10a). This was my first time shooting climbing with a film camera, much less with medium format. Given the difficulty I'm pretty happy with the results.
