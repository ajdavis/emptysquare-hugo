<p>My friend Jim Roberts emailed me this quote from <a href="http://www.cttbusa.org/vajrastrikes/masterhua.asp">Master Hua</a>, a founder of Chan Buddhism in the West:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those in search of the Way should bear this in mind: "I will pick up what others discard." What others do not want, I want; what others will not eat, I will eat; what others will not suffer, I will suffer; what others will not tolerate, I will tolerate; what others will not permit, I will permit; what others will not do, I will do. If you want to support others, you must do it from below. "Seeking the Way from a lower place" means starting from below, not standing up at the top of the mountain. You will never see the Way from the top of Mount Sumeru; but when you are at the very bottom of Mount Sumeru, there you will find the Way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim says this reminds him of <a href="/blog/begging/">street retreat</a>. Yes. Here's my friend Sh&#333;in collecting cans during a street retreat last year:</p>

<p>This non-rejecting mind, this mind of spiritual poverty, is the muscle we're training when we're on the street.</p>
