<p>Welcome back, I hope you enjoyed Thanksgiving. I certainly did; among everything for which I give thanks this year, I am grateful for the contributions RÃ©mi Jolin, Andrew Svetlov, and Nikolay Novik made to Motor's asyncio integration. Their help is the greatest gift any project of mine has received.</p>
<p>And now, it's official! Motor 0.5 is released. Install it with:</p>

{{<highlight plain>}}
python -m pip install motor
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>This version of Motor is compatible with Python 2.6 through 3.5, and it can use either Tornado or asyncio. This means pip no longer automatically installs Tornado.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the changes, <a href="/motor-0-5-beta-asyncio-async-await/">read the beta announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
