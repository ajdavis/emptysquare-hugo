![A seated woman is holding a drawing, probably representing somebody’s portrait. She’s pointing a finger at a detail in the picture while turning her head to the left, as though talking to someone outside the frame of the image.](woman-holding-drawing.jpg)

This Tuesday at 6:30pm, join me and other PyGotham organizers and the PyLadies Meetup. We'll discuss what kind of talks the [PyGotham conference is looking for](https://www.papercall.io/pygotham-2017), help you write your proposals, answer questions about our talk-selection process, and eat Turkish food.
