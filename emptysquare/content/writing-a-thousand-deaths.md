<p>My colleague <a href="http://drmirror.net/">Andr&eacute; Spiegel</a> introduced me to a project, "Writing a Thousand Deaths," by German publisher Christiane Frohmann. She is compiling a thousand pieces of brief literature about death and contemporary society. The current version of 425 texts was published at the Leipzig book fair two days ago.</p>
<p>My contribution, Number 423, is <a href="/blog/good-night-sweet-hamster/">Good Night, Sweet Hamster</a>, about Gloria's death two years ago. Andr&eacute; contributed Number 170 in German; his English translation is titled <a href="http://drmirror.net/2015/03/16/tragic-alright/">Tragic, Alright</a>.</p>
<p>So far the book is mostly in German, but the final thousand-text edition will be more balanced when it debuts at the Frankfurt book fair in the fall of 2015. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tausend-schreiben-German-Christiane-Frohmann-ebook/dp/B011WKPZXS/">buy the current version on Amazon for $8</a>, and get the completed book for free when it is published. Appropriately for a book about death, proceeds go to Children's Hospice Sonnenhof in Berlin.</p>
