New York's hottest club is NYC Systems. I'm speaking there October 17 with my colleague Matthieu Humeau. We'll describe our experiment with predictive auto-scaling in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database). The other presenter that night will be Andrew Werner, talking about instrumentation of compiled code. Unfortunately for you, registrations filled up a
 half hour after they opened. [Join the waitlist](https://nycsystems.xyz/october-2024.html)! Or [watch our presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqyLP1CZDFk) on the same topic at the Data Council conference this spring.

NYC Systems is tech talk series recently begun by [Phil Eaton](https://eatonphil.com/). Phil also created a [giant online book club](https://eatonphil.com/bookclub.html) that reads books about software internals. He's talented at organizing communities, I've been observing from the sidelines and I'm impressed.
