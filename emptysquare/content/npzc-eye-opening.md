September 27, 2025. A ceremony in which the [New Paltz Zen Center](https://npzc.org/) was officially made a Zen temple. Jo An sensei brushed open the eyes of the Manjushri Bodhisattva statue on our altar. The abbot of our mother temple the Village Zendo joined and gave his blessing. A big step for my little community.
