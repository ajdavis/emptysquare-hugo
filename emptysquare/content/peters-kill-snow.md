December 5, 2024. Peter's Kill in the Gunks, during a snow shower. I ran out to get some photos of the snow falling in the morning light. While I was on the clifftop the storm returned and absolutely nuked me. It was impossible to keep my lens clean enough to take more photos, and the sunlight was blocked by clouds, so I came home.
