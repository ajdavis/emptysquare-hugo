<p>I'm taking <a href="http://www.richardrothman.com/">Richard Rothman's</a> "Photographing People" class at <a href="http://icp.org/">ICP</a> this fall. Yesterday he sent us out into the street to find a spot with nice light and photograph strangers there. I haven't done that since I made the <a href="http://www.emptysquare.net/photography/lower-east-side/">Strangers</a> project last year, but I was pleased to find I still have the courage to ask people if I can take their picture. Here's the best two from the day.</p>
