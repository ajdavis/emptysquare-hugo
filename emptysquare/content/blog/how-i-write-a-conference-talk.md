<h1 id="plan-your-time">Plan your time.</h1>
<p>Plan to begin your talk late, and not to take questions.</p>
<p>This is not the consensus approach to conference talks, so I'll argue
for it in detail when we get to your actual delivery of the talk, in a
future article. Briefly: The beginning and end are the most important
parts of your talk. You ruin the beginning by starting before people are
ready to listen, and you ruin the end, as often as not, by wincing
through a couple bad questions and finishing on a low note.</p>
<p>Better to start a few minutes late, when the audience is ready and
waiting for you. At the end, go out with a bang.</p>
<p>Now that you've decided when you'll begin and end, you know your <em>real
slot</em>. I have a putative half hour slot at PyCon, so I'll write my talk
as if I have 25 minutes.</p>
<h1 id="inspire">Inspire.</h1>
<p>Every great talk contains an element of inspiration, I believe, and a
call to action. Even though most PyCon talks are technical&mdash;they explain
how something works, or how to do something&mdash;you must still inspire us
somehow. "Go try this yourself" is a good call to action for almost any
technical talk, but "stop doing this wrong and start doing it right", or
"do more of this" can also work. If it's a non-technical talk, you might
call on us to "be generous" or "nurture our community" or "advance in
your career".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="joan-of-arc.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>Organized her talk around a call to
action.</em></span></p>
<p>So decide on a call to action. (I put mine in the title: "Write an
Excellent Programming Blog".) Then, determine how to motivate us to
respond to your call to action. What is the outcome if we do? Will we
have more fun, be better programmers, be better humans? I may spend more
than half my talk on motivation, rather than on how-to. After all, a
conference talk is a poor vehicle for teaching technical details, but
it's pretty good for inspiring people.</p>
<p>Once you have a call to action, build a talk whose purpose is to explain
why your call to action matters, and inspires your audience to respond
to it.</p>
<h1 id="outline">Outline.</h1>
<p>If your proposal was thorough enough to be accepted by PyCon, great: you
have already outlined your talk! It's a good first draft. Now revise it.</p>
<p>But some conferences' Calls For Proposals are barely two text boxes. (I
think these CFPs are a disservice to everyone.) If this is all you've
done, go back to <a href="/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/">my tips for writing a
proposal</a> and plan your talk to a PyCon
level of rigor. Outline your talk the same as you outline an essay:
decide if you are making an argument, or a telling story, or explaining
a how-to. Brainstorm as many ideas as you can, then choose the best and
arrange them to make an impact.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="advice-hostess-1200.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>Finished his talk with a great
kicker.</em></span></p>
<p>How do you arrange the talk? Same as an article, I think:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lede:</strong> Begin with a shocking, enticing statement. Say the moon is
    made of cheese, pull a rabbit from a hat&mdash;whatever's necessary to get
    the crowd interested.</li>
<li><strong>Nutgraf:</strong> Here, you summarize your talk. But for the sake of all
    that's holy please omit the typical "agenda" slide. Tell us your
    idea, in a few snappy sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> This is what you think of as your "actual talk." If it's
    an argument, back your opinion with reason and evidence. If it's a
    story, tell it. If it's a how-to, instruct us.</li>
<li><strong>Kicker:</strong> A surprising twist, a rousing conclusion, a call
    to action. Inspire us to storm the barricades! Speakers prepare this
    part the least, but it matters most. If you want to be remembered,
    it's easy: just finish your talk with a great kicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice what's missing? Introducing yourself. Those opening moments are
key, and "who am I" just wastes them. I might say only "I'm a Python and
C programmer at MongoDB" and leave it at that, or not introduce myself
at all. The audience doesn't want to know who I am, they want to hear my
idea!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="canrobert-1200.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>No one cared how he earned his
medals.</em></span></p>
<h1 id="rehearse-immediately">Rehearse immediately.</h1>
<p>Before your outline is close to finished, start rehearsing it. Stand up
and say stuff to the walls. Discover what you really know and care
about, by listening to the parts of your talk that flow freely. (This is
not my original thought, I adapted it from Sasha Laundy's <a href="http://blog.sashalaundy.com/blog/2015/02/23/how-i-prep-in-the-24-hours-before-a-conference-talk/">"How I Prep in the 24 Hours Before Giving a Conference Talk"</a>.) If you spend too much time outlining before
you begin talking to the walls, your outline becomes a prison for your
real passion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="pass-solitude.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>Obsessed over his outline.</em></span></p>
<p>I know you've sat through boring talks. The speaker wanted to be there,
originally&mdash;where did that passion go? It might have got imprisoned
during the outlining phase.</p>
<h1 id="make-room-for-new-insights">Make room for new insights.</h1>
<p>So don't let this happen to you! Extemporize to the walls, rehearse in
your head while you ride the subway, do research, and think more about
your topic. What is it that drives you to risk your dignity on stage at
a conference? It's doubtless evolved since you proposed your talk; after
all, you wrote the proposal months ago.</p>
<p>What is the thought you have <strong>now</strong> that's so exciting you can't contain
it? Once you're certain of the answer, then you can finish your outline.</p>
<h1 id="put-off-making-slides">Put off making slides.</h1>
<p>Besides outlines, slides are the other enemy of your actual talk. For
me, slides and outlines are dangerous in different ways: outlining
curdles my thinking before it's ready, whereas slides are a way to
procrastinate the task of thinking at all.</p>
<p><img alt="Painter Felix Ziem sitting at his
easel" src="Felix_Ziem_dans_son_atelier.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>Worked on his slides so long he never wrote
his talk.</em></span></p>
<p>It's not your fine slide art that will move the audience, it's the
clarity and passion of your thinking. Try to rely only on a rough
outline as long as possible while rehearsing your talk. It leaves you
free to rearrange your talk, or overhaul it to reflect a new insight. If
you have a week left before the conference and you haven't finished your
slides, don't worry&mdash;it might be better that way, it forces you to keep
them simple.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you've finished thinking by then!</p>
<h1 id="rehearse-with-friends">Rehearse with friends.</h1>
<p>You'll know if you really care about your talk, and if you really mean
it, when you deliver it face-to-face with friends. Your friends don't
have to be tough critics: you'll just get that icky dead feeling if
you're giving a rote speech to someone close. Use that feeling. Go back
and find where you left your passion, and pick it up again.</p>
<p>I'll trade rehearsals with my friends like Anna Herlihy and Amy Hanlon
before PyCon this spring. They've spoken at conferences and they know my
subjects, my audience, and me&mdash;they'll point out how I can improve.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="private-conversation.jpg" /></p>
<p><span style="color: gray"><em>Spent the soir√©e rehearsing their PyCon talks
for each other.</em></span></p>
<h1 id="get-a-coach">Get a coach.</h1>
<p>Friends help, but a professional speaking coach takes you to a different
level. My friend and coach Melissa Collom helps me craft my argument and
delivery (<a href="http://melissacollom.com/coaching/">and she can help you with
yours</a>&mdash;shameless plug). She's an
opera singer, so she can teach me to command a stage and use my voice,
but she's also got a knack for structuring a story or an opinion. In
my sessions with her I don't just refine the talk I'm prepping now; I
learn techniques for future talks, and for any kind of persuasive
speaking. Besides, working with her is a lot more fun than rehearsing to
the walls.</p>
<h1 id="excel">Excel.</h1>
<p>Your talk doesn't have to be great. I think that most software
conferences, unfortunately, set a low bar. PyCon's standards are higher,
but still&mdash;you won't be sent away for being dull.</p>
<p>But what if you <strong>want</strong> to give a great talk? It won't happen
automatically. You have to think hard, discover the idea that you really
care about, and write an inspiring talk that motivates us to respond to
your call to action. And then, prepare as you would for any performance,
like singing or ballet: get a coach. Plan, train, and practice.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to your talk!</p>
