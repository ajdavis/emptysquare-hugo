<p>Image: <a href="http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/gutenberg/">Etching by Guillaume-Alphonse Cabasson, 1840</a>. It depicts a sculpture of Johannes Gutenberg made by David D’Angers in 1839 and unveiled June 24, 1840. It can be seen in Strasbourg, where Gutenberg lived between 1434 and 1444. The French inscription, "Et la lumière fut," means "And there was light."</p>
