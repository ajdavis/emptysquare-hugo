<p>I've used a lot of software development tools since I first taught
myself to program in high school (using Turbo C++ and Windows 3.1 —
those were the days). Now I use emacs for quick tasks, but I spend most
of my time in:</p>

<p>PyCharm takes a solid minute to start up, but saves me hours when I'm
writing Python. Its interactive debugger is fast and solid (far better
than Komodo's) and its editor has tons of nice features, like
highlighting uninitialized variables and unused imports. If I start
using a module without importing it, one keystroke will insert the
import at the top of my file (and keep my imports alphabetized!) without
leaving my current position in the code. Like any rich IDE, there's no
end to the features and keyboard shortcuts I have to learn, but every
day I get a little faster with it. It has a nice integrated test-runner,
with code-coverage charts, and I hear it has a lot of Django integration
features I've yet to try.</p>

GUIs</a>,
but Tower proves him wrong. It's a fast, pretty GUI, but the killer
feature is its "stage chunk" feature. When using git from the
commandline, I'm rarely willing to endure the suffering of committing
some chunks of changes and leaving others uncommitted. With Git Tower, I
do this constantly. I embark on a multi-hour hackathon, dealing with
multiple features and bugs, and when everything's working OK, I commit
my changes in nicely organized sets of chunks.</p>

you knew about the git command line, and that won't bother you a bit.</p>
