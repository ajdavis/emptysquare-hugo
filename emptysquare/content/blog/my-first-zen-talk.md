<p>The morning of March 29, <a href="http://villagezendo.org/2014/10/shuso-hossen-for-a-jesse-jiryu-davis/">I will give my first Zen talk</a>. I will be challenged by my community in dharma combat, a snappy give-and-take where my insight is tested. If I pass the test, I'll be a senior Zen student, with the authority to talk about the dharma, so watch out! I'll spew even more bullshit than I do now.</p>
<p>You should come to my talk, and the wild Japanese Buddhist ceremony around it called "shuso hossen." The show starts 9:30 am. If you feel generous you can leave $20 in the pot.</p>
