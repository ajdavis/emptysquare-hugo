<p>Async frameworks like Tornado scramble our usual unittest strategies: how can you validate the outcome when you do not know when to expect it?

You can also <a href="/blog/eventually-correct-async-testing-tornado/">read my article on the topic</a> or see <a href="/blog/screencast-of-eventually-correct-async-testing-with-tornado/">a screencast which I closed-captioned</a>.</p>
