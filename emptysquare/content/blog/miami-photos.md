<p>I'm starting to use color; here's some shots from <a href="/blog/what-its-like-to-work-for-10gen/">10gen's annual meeting</a>, which was in Miami this year.</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="miami-1.jpg" alt="Miami 1" title="miami-1.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="miami-2.jpg" alt="Miami 2" title="miami-2.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p>This is on Kodak Portra 400, with a Norita 66. Mistakes were made: Photographing from my hotel balcony, I didn't notice that the railing's edge was in the frame. And I shot 7 rolls but my flash only synced on a handful of photos. I'll reread the manual before I use the Norita again.</p>
