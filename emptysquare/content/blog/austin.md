<p>I'm visiting my old hometown Austin this week.</p>
<p>Tuesday night I'll be at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-MongoDB-User-Group/events/149271562/">Austin MongoDB User Group talking about how to become a Python contributor</a>.</p>
<p>Wednesday night I'm speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/austinpython/events/140075912/">Austin Python Meetup</a>. I'll give a shorter version of the same talk about contributing to Python, and I'll present on async frameworks, specifically Tornado: What is it, how does it work, and what is it good for?</p>
<p>So come say hi if you're in Austin, and tell me in the comments: what's new in Austin in the last 10 years that I should check out during my visit?</p>
