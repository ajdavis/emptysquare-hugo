<p>Welcome back, I hope you enjoyed Thanksgiving. I certainly did; among everything for which I give thanks this year, I am grateful for the contributions R&eacute;mi Jolin, Andrew Svetlov, and Nikolay Novik made to Motor's asyncio integration. Their help is the greatest gift any project of mine has received.</p>
<p>And now, it's official! Motor 0.5 is released. Install it with:</p>
<div class="codehilite" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">python -m pip install motor
</pre></div>


<p>This version of Motor is compatible with Python 2.6 through 3.5, and it can use either Tornado or asyncio. This means pip no longer automatically installs Tornado.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the changes, <a href="/blog/motor-0-5-beta-asyncio-async-await/">read the beta announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
