<hr />
<p>I'm speaking Tuesday night in Philadelphia at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Software-as-Craft-Philadelphia/">Software As Craft Meetup</a>. It's 6pm at PromptWorks, 1211 Chestnut Street, Suite 400. I hope you can come!</p>
<p>Craftspeople have always learned by apprenticing with masters. The master-apprentice relationship is older than professions&mdash;older than humanity, even. If you want to nurture this ancient tradition, you must be a great mentor to your junior colleagues.</p>
<p>But what if you don't know how? If aren't confident in your mentorship ability, come to my talk. I've been atrocious at it in the past, then succeeded. I have a failproof plan to make any mentorship triumphant.</p>
