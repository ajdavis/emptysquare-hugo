<p>I won an Ippy, a prize for independent journalism from the CUNY Graduate
School of Journalism. First Place for Best Photo Essay! My friends at
the Lower East Side blog <a href="http://www.thelodownny.com/">The Lo-Down</a>
submitted my work for the prize&mdash;they've been pushing my little photo
career along for years.</p>
