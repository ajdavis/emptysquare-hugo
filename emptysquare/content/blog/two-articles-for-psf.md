<p>I'm delighted to tell you, I've started writing on the Python Software Foundation's blog. The PSF's communications head Diana Clarke asked me last month if I could blog for them, to share duties with their inveterate writer Mary Ann Sushinsky.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/03/genuinely-nice-chap-damien-george.html">I've talked with Damien George and Nicholas Tollervey about the effort to port Python to the new micro:bit</a>, a tiny computer the BBC is distributing to a million school children in the UK. And <a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/04/auctioneer-jackie-kazil.html">I interviewed data scientist Jackie Kazil and PSF vice-chair Lynn Root about Jackie's career</a> and her leadership of the PyLadies annual charity auction.</p>
<p>I don't plan to cross-post every time I publish on the PSF blog. I just wanted you to know how much fun I'm having, talking with prominent Python folk and keeping the community up to date about the PSF.</p>
