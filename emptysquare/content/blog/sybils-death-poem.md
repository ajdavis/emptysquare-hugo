<p>I <a href="/blog/sybil-myoshin-taylor/">wrote about my friend Sybil Myoshin Taylor's
death</a> on Thursday. It's traditional among
Zen folk to compose a death poem. Not just when we know we're going to
die soon, as Sybil did, but yearly, so we'll be ready for the
unexpected.</p>
<p>Here's Sybil's poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sailing in all weathers<br/>
For seventy-eight years<br/> 
My boat dissolves<br/>
Into the great ocean itself</p>
</blockquote>
