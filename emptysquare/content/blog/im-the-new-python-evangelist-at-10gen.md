<p>Today's my first day at <a href="http://10gen.com">10gen</a>, working on the Python
driver for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. I have a lot of ideas
about what to do next, but we shall see what the next few months bring.
My first priorities are to improve testing for pymongo, update its
feature set to match what the latest MongoDB server can do, and help
make the interface to MongoDB more consistent across the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Drivers">dozen
languages we support</a>.</p>
