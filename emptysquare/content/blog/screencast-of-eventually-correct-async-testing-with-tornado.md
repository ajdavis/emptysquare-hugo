<p>In preparation for <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/404/">my PyCon talk today in Montr&eacute;al</a> I recorded and closed-captioned a screencast of it. This is a talk about testing asynchronous Python code with <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>. I also wrote <a href="/blog/eventually-correct-async-testing-tornado/">an article that covers this talk</a>, plus additional information about testing with coroutines.</p>
