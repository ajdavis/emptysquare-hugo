<p>The Software as Craft Philadelphia Meetup generously invited me down to Philly this week and they recorded my March To Triumph As A Mentor talk.</p>
<p>The video is queued at 11:20 when I start speaking. But if you back up to minute 4, Dana Giordano's lightning talk about transitioning into Rails coding mid-career is insightful and worth watching.</p>
