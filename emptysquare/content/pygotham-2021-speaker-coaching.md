I help organize [PyGotham.TV](https://pygotham.tv), NYC's annual conference about the Python programming language, plus an eclectic mix of policy, culture, open source software, and hacks. For the last few years we've provided speakers with the services of a professional speaking coach, opera singer Melissa Collom. In the past we limited coaching to first-time speakers, but we can coach everyone now. If your talk was accepted to PyGotham 2021 you'll get an email with instructions for signing up for coaching, I urge you to do so: nothing will improve the quality of your presentation, and your enjoyment of it, like an hour with Melissa.

And if you're preparing a talk for something **other** than PyGotham, [Melissa's available for hire](https://melissacollom.com/coaching)!
