<p>Last month <a href="/blog/against-resourcewarnings-in-python-3/">I griped about ResourceWarnings in Python
3</a>, arguing they're a
useless irritation in a language that can clean up resources
automatically. Python core developer <a href="http://www.boredomandlaziness.org/">Nick
Coghlan</a> responded in the comments
and I understand the choice now.</p>
<p>Nick explains that ResourceWarnings reveal problems that would make the
Python standard library inefficient running in PyPy. A resource like a
socket can clean itself up promptly in CPython, but now that it issues a
ResourceWarning when it isn't explicitly closed, the socket helps
library authors prepare for PyPy, in which resources are <strong>not</strong>
promptly cleaned up. If I decide that lazy cleanup is ok, I can avoid
ResourceWarnings by using a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/weakref.html#weakref.ref">weakref
callback</a> to
close the resource before it's deleted, whenever that happens.</p>
<p>Nick also pointed out that ResourceWarnings are off by default in normal
Python programsâ€”I just saw them all the time because I usually run my
code in <code>nosetest</code>.</p>

<p>Props to Nick for taking the time to explain.</p>
