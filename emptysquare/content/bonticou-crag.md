June 3, 2024. A Gunks cliff at sunset. I did a quick hike to the cliff in the evening and scrambled up, then I alternated taking photos and eating a sandwich as the light changed. A couple of these are HDRs: I steadied my digital camera on some rocks and took three exposure-bracketed frames, then merged them in Lightroom. The blossoms are mountain laurel.
