Gunks climber [Liza Mills](https://www.instagram.com/liza___mills/) on the routes [Lisa](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106148478/lisa) and [The Sting](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105898985/the-sting) with her husband Jordan and their cat [Dwayne](https://www.instagram.com/dwaynetheadventurecat/). The Sting ends with a dramatic dyno to a ledge; Liza latched it and sent the route on her first try of the day, but I'm including a photo of her falling on a repeat attempt, for spice.

Shot on 35mm Portra 400 with a Canon EOS10, which has a rather fast motor drive for sports photography.
