Each year the Python core developers and a handful of Python community members have an exclusive one-day summit to discuss the future of the language. The presentations are not recorded and only one reporter is allowed&mdash;this year, I was the fortunate reporter invited to cover the summit for the Python Software Foundation's blog.

The event is just a nerdy little meeting of 40 or so people in a conference room. But this nerdy little meeting is consequential: Python is perhaps the most widely-used programming language, and the core developers' decisions affect millions of programmers.
