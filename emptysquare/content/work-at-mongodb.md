<p>My company makes MongoDB. It's by far the most widely used NoSQL database and it's a very sexy chunk of open source software. But we've been hampered by our opaque company name: 10gen. Today 10gen is gone; we've renamed ourselves MongoDB, Inc.</p>
<p>It seems like a good day to invite you to come work with me. <a href="http://jobvite.com/m?3bkZ1gwg">We have open positions</a> for programmers, marketers, salespeople, and a few other specialties here in New York City, in Palo Alto, and around the globe.</p>
<p>Almost everything we make is open source. We give away the database itself, and the drivers in more than a dozen programming languages, and a bunch of tools and example applications. We make money from customer support contracts and our continuous-backup service. Being a programmer at an open-source company means I have few secrets and I come to work to share my ideas and my effort with the world. My daily motivation is generosity rather than competition. It's a beautiful feeling.</p>
<p>Another benefit of working here is personal freedom. Most days I'm hacking on PyMongo or MongoDB, but some days there's a blog post I want to write, sometimes I speak at conferences or meetups, some days <a href="https://codereview.appspot.com/7751044/">I work with Guido van Rossum on a contribution to Python</a> or <a href="https://github.com/facebook/tornado/pull/789">with Ben Darnell on a Tornado feature</a>. I participate in the free software world like I never have before.</p>
<p>If a gig like this sounds good to you, please <a href="http://jobvite.com/m?3bkZ1gwg">look at our positions and apply through this link</a>&mdash;I'll get a kickback and you'll get a fulfilling job. Maybe even a liberating one.</p>
