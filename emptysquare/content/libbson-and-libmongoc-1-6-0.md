{{< gallery path="libbson-and-libmongoc-1-6-0" >}}

I'm pleased to announce version 1.6.0 of libbson and libmongoc,
the libraries constituting the MongoDB C Driver.

# **libbson**

New features and bug fixes:

* Use jsonsl instead of libyajl as our JSON parsing library, parse JSON more
strictly, fix minor parsing bugs.
* Extended JSON documents like ``{"$code": "...", "$scope": {}}`` are now parsed
into BSON "code" elements.
* ISO8601 dates now allow years from 0000 to 9999 inclusive. Before, years
before 1970 were prohibited.
* BSON floats and ints are now distinguished in JSON output.
* The library is now built and continuously tested with MinGW-W64 on Windows.
* The documentation is ported from Mallard XML to ReStructured Text, the
HTML documentation is restyled, and numerous man page syntax errors fixed.
* All public functions now have the ``__cdecl`` calling convention on Windows.

# **libmongoc**

It is my please to announce mongo-c-driver 1.6.0.

New features and bug fixes:

* Enterprise authentication on Windows now uses the native GSSAPI library;
Cyrus SASL is no longer required for enterprise auth on Windows.
* BSON documents are more thoroughly validated before insert or update.
* New function ``mongoc_uri_set_mechanism_properties`` to replace all the
authMechanismProperties on an existing URI.
* ``mongoc_uri_get_mechanism_properties`` asserts its inputs are not NULL.
* For consistency with other MongoDB drivers, ``mongoc_collection_save`` is
deprecated in favor of ``mongoc_collection_insert`` or ``mongoc_collection_update``.
* The driver is now built and continuously tested with MinGW-W64 on Windows.
* Experimental support for HPUX.
* The correct operation ids are now passed to Command Monitoring callbacks.
* Fix a crash if the driver couldn't connect to the server to create an index.
* The documentation is ported from Mallard XML to ReStructured Text, the
HTML documentation is restyled, and numerous man page syntax errors fixed.
* Getter functions for options in ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_t``:
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_bypass_document_validation``
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_fields``
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_flags``
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_max_time_ms``
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_sort``
* ``mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_update``
* All public functions now have the ``__cdecl`` calling convention on Windows.
