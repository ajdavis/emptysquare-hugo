<p>I'm visiting Nashville Tennessee for the first time! I'm going to eat hot chicken and do everything I highlighted in the <a href="http://wildsam.com/product/nashville-tn-book/">Wildsam Guide</a>. My girlfriend Jennifer is coming with me; she wants to be an extra on the "Nashville" show.</p>
<p>I'm speaking <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nashville-MongoDB-User-Group/events/219706491/">Thursday night, February 5, at the Nashville MongoDB User Group</a>. I'll demo an application I built with MongoDB, Python, and NumPy to visualize historical weather data.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, Feburary 7, I'm giving a talk I'm excited about: "Dodge Disasters and March to Triumph as a Mentor" at the PyTennessee conference.</p>
<p>What's the best thing in Nashville? Tell me in the comments what I cannot omit from my trip.</p>
