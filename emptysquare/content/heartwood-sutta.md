My fellow [Village Zendo](https://villagezendo.org) student [Jeff Berman](https://www.jeff-berman.com/) composed a percussion quartet played on leaves and scraps of raw wood. The debut performance was at [Big Reuse](https://www.bigreuse.org/service/who-we-are/), a warehouse in Gowanus that recycles demolition waste. The music was inspired by a story about in the Pali Canon about a woodworker who seeks to harvest "heartwood", the hardest timber at the center of the tree. I covered the performance for Tricycle Magazine:
