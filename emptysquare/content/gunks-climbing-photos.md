May 7, 2023. [Irene Yee taught a climbing photography clinic](https://www.ladylockoff.com/clinics) in the Gunks, in collaboration with [Rise Outside](https://www.riseoutside.org/). I had some [experience hanging from a rope and photographing climbers](/peterskill/) before I took the class. But Irene presented principles, methods, and tricks that went far beyond what I had figured out on my own. Here's a selection of photos I took during her clinic.
