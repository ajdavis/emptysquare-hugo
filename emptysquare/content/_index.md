I'm a senior staff engineer at [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) in New York City, specializing in C++ and distributed systems. I wrote [Motor, the async MongoDB Python driver](http://motor.readthedocs.org/), and I've contributed to the [MongoDB C Driver](http://mongoc.org/), [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/), [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [Python](http://python.org), and [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/). I studied at the [International Center for Photography](https://www.icp.org/school) and I practice at the [Village Zendo](http://villagezendo.org/). You can [read more about me](/about/) or [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis).
