September 28, 2025. Chris climbing [Ridicullissima](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105888125/ridicullissima), a tall classic 5.10d in the Gunks. I photographed him while hanging from a rope anchored near the top of the route. At [Dustin Portzline](https://www.advancedrockcraft.com/)'s suggestion, I experimented with anchoring the other end of the rope to the ground, a hundred feet to the side of the climb. I attached myself to the rope with two Gri Gris and attempted to position myself in space by individually lengthening or shortening the two segments. It was awkward; I have a lot to learn. At least having two attachments prevented me from spinning.
