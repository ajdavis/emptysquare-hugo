<p>I took some more photos of my dwarf hamsters tonight. This is Gloria, as far as I can tell:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="hamster-1.jpg" alt="Gloria" title="hamster-1.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="hamster-2.jpg" alt="Gloria" title="hamster-2.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p>... and this must be Rhoda:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="hamster-3.jpg" alt="Rhoda" title="hamster-3.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="hamster-4.jpg" alt="Rhoda" title="hamster-4.jpg" border="0"   /></p>
<p>Rhoda seems to be scratching herself up lately, particularly her nose. But she's tough enough to survive Sandy and I'm sure she'll heal up fine.</p>
