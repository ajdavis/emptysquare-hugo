Holy Week services (Maundy Thursday, Good Friday) at [Christ Episcopal Church](https://www.christchurchpok.org/history-christ-church/) in Poughkeepsie. The church has operated since the 1760s; the current building was erected in 1889. My friend Emily is the church's associate rector, she was [ordained there](/christ-episcopal-ordination/) last year. She invited me to photograph the services this month.
