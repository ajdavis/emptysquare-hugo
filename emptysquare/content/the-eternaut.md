In late-1950s Buenos Aires, on a quiet night, Juan is in his attic, playing cards with his close friends. The radio plays in the background. Juan's wife and daughter are downstairs. On their suburban street, snow begins to fall. The music on the radio turns to static. Out the window, Juan sees cars crashing, pedestrians dropping dead: the snow is glowing, toxic, everyone it touches dies in seconds. It's the prelude to an alien invasion. Juan's family and friends are lucky: the windows were all closed, and Juan's modern house is tightly sealed. They fashion hazmat suits from spare parts and venture out to gather supplies for their survival.

Over the next few days they'll witness mass death, anarchy, waves of attacks by various weird aliens and crazy weapons, the destruction of the Argentine army, and perhaps the end of humanity. In the story's final moments, Juan tries to steal an alien ship, but presses the wrong button and gets teleported to another dimension, doomed eternally to wander space and time, searching for his wife and daughter.

The Eternaut (_El Eternauta_), written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld, was serialized in an Argentine sci-fi magazine from 1955 to 1957. It's drawn by Francisco Solano López in a pulpy style, though with expert brushwork and composition.

Oesterheld wrote the story in the aftermath of Juan Perón's overthrow and [an airstrike against a pro-Perón rally in Buenos Aires's central square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Plaza_de_Mayo), which killed hundreds of civilians. I don't know much about Argentina's history, and I'm confused about Oesterheld's opinion of Perón and the coup. Everyone has to agree that the bombing of the Plaza de Mayo was an atrocity, I assume. But in The Eternaut, it's the good guys who bomb a plaza, trying to destroy the alien headquarters.

The themes of The Eternaut seem universal enough to be reused by any political faction. On one side of the story's conflict is a classic 50s hero, a square-jawed family man, with his brave and competent friends, a physicist and a metalworker. On the other side, inhuman and implacable enemies who bombard Buenos Aires, then use mind-control devices to enslave the survivors. They could represent the military forces that bombed civilians and overthrew Perón, or the repressive regime that followed, or the foreign imperialists who tried to manipulate Argentine politics from afar, or any foe of middle-class liberal patriotism.

The comic was published in installments, and you can see the seams between them when reading it as a book: each episode begins with a bit of recap and ends on a cliffhanger. Too many times, a major character is presumed dead and reappears improbably. But the story's pacing makes it feel like it a modern Netflix show. The alien assault is relentless, the velocity of events is hectic and disorienting, the body count is in the billions, and the only predictable plotline is that all human resistance will be crushed. The story's end is abrupt and shockingly inconclusive. We never actually see the invaders, or know for certain why they attacked and what they will do with the handful of survivors, if there are any.
