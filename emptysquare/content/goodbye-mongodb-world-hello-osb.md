<p>Today I talked to a small audience at MongoDB World in New York City. I described how I made a visualization of global weather data using MongoDB, Python, Monary, and Matplotlib. The visualization looks like this:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="weather-matplotlib.jpg" alt="Contour map of global temperature using Matplotlib" title="Contour map of global temperature using Matplotlib" /></p>
<p>My talk was one of a three-part series called "<a href="https://world.mongodb.com/mongodb-world/session/weather-century-part-1-design-overview">The Weather of the Century</a>". My colleague Randall Hunt gave a schema design talk about weather data, and Andr&eacute; Spiegel, who was the brains behind the whole idea, analyzed the performance of various MongoDB configurations executing various operations on terabytes of data.</p>
<p>In the next week I plan to write an article on how I generated this visualization. I also want to write an introduction to Monary: it's a little-known, highly specialized MongoDB driver capable of shocking throughput.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm flying to Portland, Oregon to catch the second half of Open Source Bridge. I'll exhort the audience to <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1233">write an excellent programming blog</a>. I hope they take my advice!</p>
