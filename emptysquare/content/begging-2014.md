<p>This May I'll spend four days homeless, with a Zen teacher named Genro and a small group of fellow Buddhists. We'll live, sleep, and meditate on the streets together and eat at soup kitchens. I think the retreat has a triple purpose: First, briefly abandoning the comfort and certainty of my regular life helps me practice non-attachment, the same as it helped the first Buddhist monks. Second, it gives me a taste of what it's like to be homeless, so I can better understand the homeless people I meet in NYC. And finally, it's an opportunity to raise money for homeless services.</p>
<p>People often ask me whether, by doing street retreat, we're competing with homeless people for scarce resources. I think not&mdash;we stay at the back of the line in soup kitchens, in case there's not enough food, and we sleep on sidewalks instead of in shelters. We beg for a few dollars on the street, but we donate thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The rule is that I must raise $500 by May 8. The money will be distributed among the organizations that help us while we're on the street, and it will support the social service activities of the <a href="http://hudsonriverzencenter.org/">Hudson River Zen Center</a>. I have to beg for the money&mdash;I'm not allowed to just donate $500 of my own.</p>
<p>So I'm begging you: Will you please donate?</p>
