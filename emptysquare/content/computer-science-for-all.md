<p>MongoDB offered a paid fellowship to two teachers this summer. Jeremy Mellema and Tim Chen worked with the MongoDB Education Team in our office, developing a computer science curriculum based on Python, MongoDB, and other technologies. This fall, they're starting to teach the new class in NYC public high schools in Hell's Kitchen and the Bronx.</p>
<p>I followed them for a day, talking to them and their students and taking pictures. Read the story on the MongoDB Engineering Journal:</p>
