I'll be in London the week of November 14th for MongoDB Europe. I'll talk about building resilient applications with MongoDB, and a bunch of other experts will talk about advanced techniques, real-world experiences, and what the future holds. You should come: use code `mdbe20` for a 20% discount.

It's been so long since I was in London, let me know in the comments what to eat, drink, and see next month.
