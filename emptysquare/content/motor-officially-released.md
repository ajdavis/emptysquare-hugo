<p>It's happened. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/motor">Motor 0.1 is in PyPI</a>. You can now install it with a simple:</p>
<div class="codehilite" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #19177C">$ </span>pip install motor
</pre></div>


<p>This is the first official, production release of Motor.</p>
<p>That said, there will be bugs: please <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MOTOR">file them</a> and I'll respond as quickly as I can.</p>

<h1 id="motors-future">Motor's Future</h1>
<p>Motor is now feature-complete and fully tested. I expect to put it on the back burner and concentrate on other projects.</p>
<p>Motor will keep up easily with PyMongo development, because I designed it to. I don't intend for it to lag more than a smidge. For example, PyMongo 2.5 will bring some new security and authentication features; in the following Motor release I'll support those, too.</p>
<p>I believe this is the coolest thing I've ever made. I hope you have fun with it. <a href="https://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis">Tweet me</a> and let me know what you build with it.</p>
