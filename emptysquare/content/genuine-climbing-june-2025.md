June 2025. A [climbing retreat in the Gunks for women with cancer](https://genuineclimbing.org/climbing-with-cancer-2/) led by Anyssa Lucena of Genuine Climbing. Most of the women had never climbed outside, or never climbed at all. Their awe of the rock reminded me of when I fell in love with climbing, years ago. [Eric Bates](https://www.ericbates.com/) and a small crew were shooting a documentary of the retreat. He made [Five Dot Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BswG4bnk6To), one of my favorites; I was excited to meet him and watch him work.
