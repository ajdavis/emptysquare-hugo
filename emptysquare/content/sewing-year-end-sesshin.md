<p>December 2014. Sewing comforters for animals in shelters, during the Village Zendo's year-end meditation retreat.</p>
<p>Zen emphasizes work as a meditative and spiritual practice. During our year-end retreat we sew comforters for sheltered animals and donate them to <a href="http://www.animalalliancenyc.org/help/other/comforters.htm">The Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals</a>. The comforters don't just give animals something soft to lie on: people are more willing to adopt a dog or cat when they see it on a cute comforter. The comforter goes with the animal to its new home and helps it make the transition.</p>
