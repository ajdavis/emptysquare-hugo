I'm looking forward to PyTennessee this February in Nashville. It's a friendly Python conference, not too big, with great talks and smart people. Kind of like the city of Nashville itself: friendly and not too big.

This year I'm giving two talks. One is about keeping our temper with beginners when they ask basic programming questions, the other is a CPython internals talk about destructors.
