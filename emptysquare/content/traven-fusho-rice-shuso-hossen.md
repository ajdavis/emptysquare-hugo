<p>March 20, 2016. Shuso hossen, a ceremony in which we confirm a member as a senior student empowered to give dharma talks. This spring's shuso hossen was for Traven Fusho Rice, at the end of <a href="https://villagezendo.org/events/urbansesshin2016/">the four-day retreat she led, exploring gender identity in art</a>.</p>
