I climbed with five friends in Red Rocks, outside Las Vegas. We had a medium-disappointing week. The sandstone there is fragile for a day or two after it rains, and it rained twice, so we were relegated to mediocre limestone climbing instead of world-class sandstone for most of the trip. Even on the limestone days our time was cut short by cold winds and occasional hail. My major objectives like [The Fox](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105732254/the-fox) and [Cactus Massacre](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/114115286/cactus-massacre) will have to wait. I never took out my Canon, but I had some fun with my phone camera.
