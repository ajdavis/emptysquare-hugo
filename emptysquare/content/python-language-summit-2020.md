For the second year in a row, I was invited to report on the Python Language Summit. It's a private gathering of Python language implementers (both the core developers of CPython and alternative Pythons), plus third-party library authors and other Python community members. This year, the Summit was held over two days by videoconference. I'm no longer mainly a Python programmer, but it's still exciting to hear new ideas for the language. The core developers' decisions affect millions of programmers; it's a privilege to be in the room where it happens.
