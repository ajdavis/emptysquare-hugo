<p>It was a treat to talk with Saúl Ibarra Corretgé and Andrey Salomatin for Episode Three of the Code Podcast. We discussed async event loops and coroutines in Python 3 and libuv.</p>
<p>Andrey doesn't simply broadcast an interview: he carefully edits his episodes to tell a story about a specific subject, setting him apart from all the other podcasts about software. Less like Charlie Rose, more like Radiolab. I'm eager to hear the next one.</p>
