![Photo of a fragment of a statue of an ancient Egyptian pharaoah](younger-memnon.png)

I met a programmer of an antique tongue  
Who said: A vast, maintainerless pile of code  
Lies in GitHub. All around it flung  
Half-finished branches where development slowed,  
And READMEs full of bombast, heralding features  
Tell that its authors once with passion toiled  
Without release, their hearts chained to their object,  
Until their hearts gave out, their ardor spoiled:  
And in the manual these words appear:  
"My name is Fossymandias, the Greatest Project:  
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"  
No further boasts were heard from the engineers  
Of that colossal wreck. Boundless and bare  
The empty commit log stretches countless years.
