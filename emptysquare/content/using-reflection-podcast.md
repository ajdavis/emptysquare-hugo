I had a revealing conversation with my old colleague Mark Weiss on his new podcast, "Using Reflection." We talked about the software industry's sorry lack of mentorship, we contrasted the short-term mindset I had when I was a freelancer versus my long-term commitment to my team at MongoDB, and I described the influence of my Zen practice on my career as a programmer.
