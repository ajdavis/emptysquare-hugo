<p>The update to Google Reader highlights a profound error in Google's
interface updates: Each update decreases information density.</p>
<p>With Google Reader's new interface, I can see a list of only 12 new
articles. I subscribe to 115 blogs, so I need a little more information
to fit on one screen, thank you very much. The main problem is the ocean
of white space in which all the controls now float. On my Macbook Pro,
the actual information I want — the list of new articles — is allotted
only 54% of the browser window:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="google-reader1.png" title="Google reader" /></p>
<p>Google seems to be aware that we might want some of our info back on our
screens; they've published <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1670219">a FAQ about increasing info density in
GMail</a>,
but alas the density control they describe doesn't exist in most of
their products, like Reader.</p>
<p>Dear Google: a cluttered interface is one with lots of <strong>kinds</strong> of
information, not one with lots of info. The point of an uncluttered
interface is to let me see lots of useful data. By adding more
whitespace, and decreasing information density, you are accomplishing
the opposite of what an uncluttered interface should do.</p>
<p>But maybe I shouldn't throw stones, since this blog itself uses a lot of
whitespace. I argue that I don't need to present much data to you,
compared to what Google Reader must present, so I can afford the
SoHo-gallery look. What do you think?</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://brianshih.com/78073742">Google Reader's ex-product
manager</a> has some very harsh things to
say about the new Reader.</p>
