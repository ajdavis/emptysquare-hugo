<p>This Thursday in NYC I'm talking about Python, MongoDB, and asynchronous
web frameworks at a meetup called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/events/47656622/">For the Love of Python: Wine tasting,
Red velvet cupcakes, and Tech
Talks</a>. The talk is a
work in progress. To be strictly accurate, I have not yet started
working on the talk, because the code I'll be talking about is itself a
work in progress. But come anyway, because I've been thinking a lot on
this subject for the last few months, and I intend to present:</p>
<p>A high-level discussion of what an async web framework is and when you
need it, or don't. I think there's a lot of sloppiness on this subject,
and I want to work with the audience on tightening up our thinking.</p>
<p>A review of pymongo, pthreads, Tornado, asyncmongo, and gevent. You
won't be disappointed.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, I will present an exclusive sneak-peak at my
own experimental Python driver for MongoDB and Tornado, built on top of
the official pymongo driver. It's pretty snazzy, it uses greenlets, and
it's an example of a general pattern for asynchronizing synchronous
database drivers that might inspire you to write your own database
driver in Python. Buckle your seatbelts, we're going deep.</p>
