<p>I'm so excited to tell you, my colleague Samantha Ritter and I were accepted to speak in Portland, Oregon this June.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/1580">Cat-herd's Crook: Enforcing Standards in 10 Programming Languages</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Samantha and I helped specify and test how MongoDB drivers behave in ten programming languages, and we persuaded dozens of open source programmers to implement these specifications the same. We created a test framework that verified compliance with YAML descriptions of how drivers should act, and we communicated updates to the specs by pushing changes to the YAML files.</p>
<p>We want to show you how we herded all the cats in the same direction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/1582">How Do Python Coroutines Work?</a></strong></p>
<p>I'll explain asyncio's new coroutine implementation in depth, including the mystical "yield from" statement. You'll know better than any of your peers how this amazing new programming model works. Plus, in a magical and entertaining feat of daring, I plan to live-code an asynchronous coroutine implementation before your very eyes!</p>
