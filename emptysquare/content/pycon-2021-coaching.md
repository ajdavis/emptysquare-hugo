I get professional coaching for nearly every conference talk I deliver. Now that most conference talks are pre-recorded videos shot from home, I need more help than ever to make my talks polished, convincing, and fun. I rely on my friend Melissa Collom, an opera singer and experienced coach who's trained speakers at PyGotham, PyOhio, and PyTennessee for many years.

Are you prepping your PyCon 2021 talk this month? No matter what stage you're at, Melissa can help you write, rehearse, and record your talk and make you a star.

I urge you to [book an appointment with her](https://www.dynamic-communication.com/).
