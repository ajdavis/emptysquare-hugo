(This era didn't have a monopoly on amazing names: one of the American officers who decided the fate of Korea after WWII was named [Tick Bonesteel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Bonesteel_III).)

(This era didn't have a monopoly on confusing factions. Future historians will have as much trouble explaining which political groups in America are pro- or anti-Jewish now, or whose interests are served by Trump's economic policies, as they have explaining the shifting alliances of Levellers, Independents, Engagers, and so on.)
