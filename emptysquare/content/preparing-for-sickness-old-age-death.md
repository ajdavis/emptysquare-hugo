<p><img alt="&quot;Mort du capitaine Flottard&quot;: The captain of a ship is about to die on a bed that has been made for him on a raft. The members of the crew are gathered, kneeling around him." src="mort-du-capitaine-flottard.jpg" /></p>
<p>After years of procrastination, my girlfriend Jennifer and I filled out our advance directives, healthcare proxies, and wills.</p>
<h2 id="advance-directive-and-healthcare-proxy">Advance Directive and Healthcare Proxy</h2>
<p>In my "advance directive", also known as a "living will", I left instructions for how I should be treated if I'm incapacitated.</p>
<p>When I searched for a template, the first I found was Five Wishes. It's well-known, but I resented the &dollar;5 fee to download it, and the sample directives included:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious: "I wish for my bed linens to be kept clean,"</li>
<li>the absurd: "I wish to be massaged with warm oils as often as I can be,"</li>
<li>and the unenforcible: "I wish for my family and friends to think about what I was like before I became seriously ill. I want them to remember me in this way after my death."</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization has a no-nonsense form:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.caringinfo.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3289">Download Your State's Advance Directives</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The form designates who will make decisions for me when I cannot, and my advance instructions. I designated Jennifer and my mother, and instructed them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want life-sustaining treatment withheld if I'm terminally ill, or at least 80
years old, or if there's a less than 50% chance that I will recover reasonable
physical ability. Additionally, withhold life-sustaining treatment if there is
more than a 25% chance that I will live with irreversible dementia or other
mental impairment of any sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The form need not be notarized in New York, so Jennifer and I just signed ours with a friend as witness, put them in our files, and mailed copies to our families.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-resuscitate">Do Not Resuscitate</h2>
<p>The form's instructions warn me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be aware that your New York document will not be effective in the event of a medical emergency. Ambulance and hospital emergency department personnel are required to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) unless they are given a separate directive that states otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what a "do not resuscitate" or "DNR" order is for, and it's separate from the advance directive. I didn't sign one: I'm young enough that if ER doctors think they can revive me, they should give it a shot. (Although <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/the-cpr-we-dont-see-on-tv/">it usually doesn't work</a>.)</p>
