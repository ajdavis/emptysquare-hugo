I've participated in a [Distributed Systems Reading Group](http://charap.co/category/reading-group/) for the last year. Each week we read a recent research paper, one of us presents it to the group, and we hold a discussion. This week I presented [Pegasus: Tolerating Skewed Workloads in Distributed Storage with In-Network Coherence Directories](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi20-li_jialin.pdf). The authors describe a distributed key-value store implemented on a rack of servers, with a very clever protocol programmed into the [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) of the switch itself.
