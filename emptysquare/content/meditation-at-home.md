Photographs of [Village Zendo](https://villagezendo.org/) members in New York City, in early 2020.

Two of these photos appeared in the July 2020 print issue of Lion's Roar magazine to accompany my article about [Five Ways to Establish a Rock-Solid Meditation Habit]({{< ref "five-ways-to-establish-a-rock-solid-meditation-habit.md" >}}), and one of them in the summer edition of Buddhadharma magazine.
