Photographs of Village Zendo members in early 2020. Two of these photos appeared in the July 2020 print issue of Lion's Roar magazine to accompany my article about [Five Ways to Establish a Rock-Solid Meditation Habit]({{< ref "five-ways-to-establish-a-rock-solid-meditation-habit.md" >}}), and one of them in summer edition of Buddhadharma magazine.
