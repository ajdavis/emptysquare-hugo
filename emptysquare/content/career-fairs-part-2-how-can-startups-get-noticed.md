<p>I wrote the other day about what I think <a href="/so-youre-coming-to-a-career-fair/">Comp Sci majors are doing
wrong at career fairs</a> and how
they should be distinguishing themselves from their peers. There's a fun
debate in the comments about whether I gave the right advice.
Regardless, here's a followup question I need answered from CS
undergrads:</p>
<p><strong>If you've been to a career fair, what did startups do wrong? How can
we get you to notice us?</strong></p>
<p>When I consider how we at 10gen set ourselves up at Big Ivy University's
career fair, I don't think we did any better than the students did. We
displayed our logo and the name of our product MongoDB, and ... that's
it. I can't blame the hundred kids who came up to our table and said,
"What do you do?" We should say why an intership with us will be
awesome, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NoSQL movement is one of the most innovative areas in software
    these days, and we dominate it.</li>
<li>We're small, so if you're smart you can make a big relative
    contribution.</li>
<li>We're run by and for coders: Our CEO codes, I code, our customers
    code, everyone codes.</li>
<li>We're on the kind of growth trajectory that eventually makes
    household-name companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how to say these things convincingly, especially not on a
poster, so that a smart undergrad who's never heard of us will stop at
our table. Suggestions?</p>
