October 6, 2025. [Kelsey Roman](https://www.instagram.com/mntnbug/) performing with aerial silks while hanging from the West Trapps cliff in the Gunks. We photographed during sunset and moonrise. Rock guide [Dustin Portzline](https://www.advancedrockcraft.com/) managed Kelsey's safety rigging and filmed behind-the-scenes footage.

I photographed this with a flash while hanging from a static line. I used a [big wall harness](https://mistymountain.com/collections/cadillac) for safety, a [bosun's chair](https://blackdiamondequipment.com/products/bosuns-chair) for comfort, and a [Peak Design](https://www.peakdesign.com/) thingy that's now out of stock for clipping my camera to my harness.
