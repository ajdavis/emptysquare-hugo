I talked in Barcelona in October about being nice to newcomers who ask basic questions. We go to StackOverflow and mailing lists and forums with the intention to be generous, so why do we nevertheless act cruelly to beginners? Why do we lose our tempers? And what can we do about it?

My talk got a rocky start. I didn't realize how hard it is to get a cab in Barcelona on a rainy morning, so I arrived late. My A/V didn't work for the first few minutes. Nevertheless it was a joy to give this talk; the Python and Plone community in Barcelona was very gracious to me.
