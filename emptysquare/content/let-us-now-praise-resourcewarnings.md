<p>Luckily, Pythons aren't poisonous.</p>
<p>A couple years ago when I began using Python 3, <a href="/against-resourcewarnings-in-python-3/">its new ResourceWarnings infuriated me and I ranted against them</a>. Python core developer Nick Coghlan patiently corrected me, and I wrote a followup, <a href="/mollified-about-resourcewarnings/">"Mollified About ResourceWarnings"</a>.</p>
<p>And now, a ResourceWarning has saved my tuchus.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was fixing a bug in Motor, my asynchronous driver for MongoDB. Motor has a <code>copy_database</code> method which I'll summarize thus:</p>

{{<highlight python3>}}
@gen.coroutine
def copy_database(self, source, target):
    pool, socket = None, None
    try:
        pool = self.get_pool()
        socket = pool.get_socket()
        # ... several operations with the socket ...
    finally:
        if pool and socket:
            pool.return_socket(socket)
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>The bug occurred when the source database was password-protected. The <code>get_socket</code> call didn't ensure it was authenticated before it attempted to copy the database. I fixed the bug like so:</p>

{{<highlight python3>}}
@gen.coroutine
def copy_database(self, source, target):
    pool, socket = None, None
    try:
        member = self.get_cluster_member()
        socket = self.get_authenticated_socket_from_member(member)
        # ... several operations with the socket ...
    finally:
        if pool and socket:
            pool.return_socket(socket)
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>Whoops. I fixed the authentication bug, but introduced a socket leak. Since <code>pool</code> is now always <code>None</code>, the code in the <code>finally</code> clause never runs. In this example the bug is obvious, but the real method is 60 lines longâ€”just long enough for me not to see the mismatch between its first and final lines.</p>
<p>I blithely released the bug in Motor 0.2.</p>
<p>Apparently my users don't call <code>copy_database</code> much, since no one reported the socket leak. I'm not surprised: Motor is optimized for high-concurrency web applications, not for administrative scripts that copy databases around. If you want to copy a database you'd use the regular driver, PyMongo, instead. And so the bug lurked for three months.</p>
<p>This weekend I teased Motor apart, into two modules: a "core" module that talks to MongoDB, and a "framework" module that uses <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> for asynchronous I/O. Once I had separated the two aspects of Motor, I made a second "framework" module that uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Python 3.4's new asyncio framework</a> instead of Tornado. <code>copy_database</code> was among the first methods I tested in the new Motor-on-asyncio. It's relatively complex so I used it to give my new code a workout.</p>
<p><code>copy_database</code> worked with asyncio! But I wasn't ready to celebrate yet:</p>

{{<highlight plain>}}
ResourceWarning: unclosed <socket.socket fd=9, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 54065), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 27017)>
{{< / highlight >}}

<p>That damn ResourceWarning. I did a bit of binary-searching through my test code until I found it: I wasn't returning the socket in <code>copy_database</code>. The fix is obvious:</p>

{{<highlight python3>}}
@gen.coroutine
def copy_database(self, source, target):
    member, socket = None, None
    try:
        member = self.get_cluster_member()
        socket = self.get_authenticated_socket_from_member(member)
        # ... several operations with the socket ...
    finally:
        if socket:
            member.pool.return_socket(socket)
{{< / highlight >}}

<p><a href="/motor-0-3-2-released/">I've released this fix today in Motor 0.3.2</a>.</p>
<p>One lesson learned is: I was foolish when I made my code "robust" against unexpected conditions. The earlier code had returned the socket <code>if pool and socket</code>. But if <code>socket</code> isn't null, <code>pool</code> shouldn't be, either. So <code>if socket</code> alone should be sufficient. This simpler code, that only handles the case I expect to arise, would have failed immediately when I introduced the bug. The misguided robustness of my earlier code masked my bug for months.</p>
<p>Another lesson is: I finally understand the value of ResourceWarnings. They force me to decide when costly objects are deallocated, and they warn me if I mess it up. I'm reviewing my test procedures to ensure that ResourceWarnings are displayed. Ideally, a ResourceWarning should be converted to an exception that causes my unittests to fail. Do you know how to make that happen?</p>
