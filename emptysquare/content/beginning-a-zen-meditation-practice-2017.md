Saturday morning September 30, I'm teaching a class about Zen meditation and bringing a complete Zen practice to your daily life. The class is at the Village Zendo in downtown Manhattan, and I'm teaching it with my friend and fellow senior Zen student Traven Fusho Rice. We'll discuss:

* Zazen posture
* Making your practice your own
* Beyond Mindful: Practicing with a group and a teacher
* Village Zendo temple etiquette
* The ethical principles Zen Buddhists follow

Once this workshop is completed, you'll have what you need to begin a meditation practice at home, and you'll be ready to attend any event at the Village Zendo.
