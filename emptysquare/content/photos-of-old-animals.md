<p>The Times the other day linked to an excellent photo project, <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/what-we-can-learn-from-old-animals/">Isa
Leshko's "Elderly
Animals"</a>.
The Times says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Leshko was inspired to carry out her project after spending a year
caring for her mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is now in a
nursing home. She considered documenting the experience through
pictures but soon decided against it. “A number of fine-art
photographers have gone that route and produced really powerful work,”
she said. “It just didn’t feel like the appropriate response for me. I
didn’t think my mother could provide consent, and I wanted to be
present as her daughter and caregiver.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Avedon's upsetting photos of his sick father come to mind, and
Phillip Toledano's <a href="http://www.dayswithmyfather.com/">"Days With My
Father"</a>, which began as an
award-winning website and was published last year as a book.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in Leshko's "Elderly Animals" because it's a
novel subject, and because I typically find animals childlike, and the
old animals in her photos are <strong>both</strong> recognizably old and still cute
and innocent.</p>
