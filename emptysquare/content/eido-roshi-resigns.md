<p>Eido Shimano Roshi has resigned his leadership of The Zen Studies
Society, one of the oldest and most traditional Zen groups in the U.S.,
and his successor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Chayat">Shinge Roko Sherry Chayat
Roshi</a>, has taken his place.
She will lead the society and its main practice center, the Dai Bosatsu
Zendo. The society's
<a href="http://zenstudies.org/images/ZSSNewsltr11.pdf">newsletter</a> (pdf) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roshi stood before Eido Roshi, who handed a simple wooden staff to
her. For a moment, each had one hand grasping the staff, and the two
stood eye-to-eye. Eido Roshi released his grip, and the responsibility
for a sangha and a tradition shifted from teacher to heir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eido Roshi was forced from his position as a result of a sex scandal. A
pretty tame one, compared to the sorts of scandals that have plagued
American Zen since the 1960s. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/us/21beliefs.html">The New York
Times</a> last year
had a fascinating overview of the situation. Since I don't know the
people involved and have not sat with the sangha, all I can say is that
it seems very sad, and I can sympathize both with the Zen students who
wanted Eido Roshi to stay and those who lobbied to have him removed.
<strong>UPDATE: I've been corrected by commenters. In the year since I last
read up on the scandal, much more damning info has been published.
Forgive me.</strong></p>
<p>The new abbot, Shinge Roshi, announces quietly that a softer and more
democratic time is coming for The Zen Studies Society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are changes that I envision. I want to cultivate an atmosphere
that is harmonious, warm, open, and respectful of everyone. Since my
way as a teacher is more relational than hierarchical, I look forward
to sharing creative ideas with residents and visitors alike. I welcome
past and current students with deep concern for continuing our
heritage and love of the Dharma to take part in shaping the future of
Dai Bosatsu Zendo.</p>
