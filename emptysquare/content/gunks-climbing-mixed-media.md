Some of my photographer friends hand-make books, sculptures, etc. from their photos. They inspire me to be more inventive.

1. [Dustin](/dustin/) holding his own mixed-media climbing art, framed with old climbing slings.
2. Dustin training on his hangboard, framed in climbing chalk. 
3. Chris climbing [Bonticou Crag](/bonticou-climbing/), framed with local rocks.
