If you're committed to a lifetime of coding, how do you make the most of it?

Your training, experience, and passion are all in computer programming, but after a few years it can start to feel like you're being railroaded into management, or out of the industry. Full-time programmers in their 40s or older are few, and the industry doesn't reward long experience like it should. We can change this. We can find more creative ways to deepen our skills, get promoted, and expand our influence as coders for our entire careers.

This is [a keynote talk from PyTennessee in Nashville, February 10, 2019](choosing-the-adventurous-route-video.md).
