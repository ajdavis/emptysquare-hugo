<p>I spend too much time writing. It's inefficient for me to invest so much effort here.</p>
<p>Most bloggers fail to get much value from writing. They expend huge effort, then quit. Why? They think, incorrectly, that only a blog with a mass audience is worth writing. This misconception leads to disappointment, but there is a way out. The surest way to get value from writing online is to write about your passion. Write for a narrow audience that shares your specialty. Write in order to clarify your thinking, to declare yourself an expert in your specialty, and to enjoy the satisfaction of a well-expressed idea. A blog written this way is worthwhile even before anyone reads it. And besidesâ€”if you write as passionately as this, the readers you care about will come.</p>
