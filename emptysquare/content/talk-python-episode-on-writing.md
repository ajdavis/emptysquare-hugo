<p>Michael Kennedy and I talked about writing about programming. What kind of writing is most valuable, how do you choose a topic, improve your writing, find an audience, and find the time to write? Listen to the podcast on <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog">the Talk Python To Me</a> site.</p>
<p>I've talked with Michael before: <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/2/python-and-mongodb">Episode 2 of "Talk Python to Me" was about MongoDB and Python</a>.</p>
