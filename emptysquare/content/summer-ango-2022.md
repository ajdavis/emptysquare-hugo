Photos from a 10-day Zen meditation retreat, in a Catholic retreat center in rural Connecticut.

This was my Zen community's first in-person sesshin since December 2019. In the years between, I've been disconnected from the Village Zendo. While many of the sangha members met on Zoom for zazen, chanting, and various events, I focused on other practices and teachers. [Climbing has been my main spiritual practice](/244-days-off/). To sit again knee-to-knee with my sangha felt like coming home to my chosen family.
