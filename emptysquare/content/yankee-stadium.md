<p>July 10, 2013. MongoDB staff took our summer interns to a Yankees game.</p>
<p>That day I shot a few rolls of Kodak Portra NC on my medium-format Bronica, but I didn't think I had anything good so I left the film in my freezer for three years. Now that I've finally dug it out and had it developed, I like how the Portra NC represents the evening sunlight and haze.</p>
