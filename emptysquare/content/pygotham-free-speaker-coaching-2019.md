I help organize PyGotham, NYC's annual conference about the Python programming language. For the third year in a row, we're giving our speakers free sessions with a professional speaking coach, [opera singer Melissa Collom](http://melissacollom.com/coaching). In the past we've limited coaching to first-time speakers, but we're now able to coach everyone.

However, we only have budget guaranteed for the first 20 signups. If you're speaking at PyGotham, reserve your spot now:
