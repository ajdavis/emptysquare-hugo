<p><strong>Update</strong>: Sadly, we didn't make a copy of this video before Blip.tv deleted their users' content. But you can read plenty about Motor: <a href="/category/motor/">here's all my blog posts tagged "motor".</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Film student <a href="http://www.finlaycoopermedia.com/">Jack Finlay</a> generously took the time to record me reprising my talk on <a href="/motor/">Motor</a> from PyGotham this spring. The result is a good 35-minute intro to the motivations behind Motor and how I implemented it, in a fireside-chat style.</p>
<p>See? I feel like Franklin Roosevelt. The material covered is similar to my post on <a href="/motor-internals-how-i-asynchronized-a-synchronous-library/">Motor Internals: How I Asynchronized a Synchronous Library</a>.</p>
