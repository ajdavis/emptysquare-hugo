<p>November 28th, 2014. The release party for "In New York", an album of jazz songs. My long-time friend Christina Clare has joined the <a href="http://joelforrester.com/">Joel Forrester Quintet</a> to sing new songs with a retro vibe and edgy modern lyrics, it's excellent stuff. See them perform <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_APrNeGoS-E">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK2mBqvLpmc">here</a>. The album goes on sale in January.</p>
